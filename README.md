# mapboxprototyping
This Android application is built using Mapbox, Firebase, and Geofire libraries.  It will display drone locations stored on the Firebase database using Geofire.  The database contains a list of no-fly zones that the app will display along with the drone locations.  When the drone locations updata in the Firebase database the drones will animate in the app.
